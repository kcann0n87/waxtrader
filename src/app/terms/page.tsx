          <p>
            WaxDepot LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company (&quot;<strong>WaxDepot</strong>,&quot;
            &quot;<strong>we</strong>,&quot; &quot;<strong>us</strong>&quot;) operates the marketplace at{" "}
            <Link href="/" className="text-amber-300 hover:underline">
              waxdepot.io
            </Link>{" "}
            (the &quot;<strong>Service</strong>&quot;) for the resale of sealed,
            factory-original sports trading card products (&quot;<strong>Wax</strong>&quot;).
            By creating an account, listing a product, or placing an order, you agree
            to these Terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are an intermediary marketplace. <strong>We do not own, hold, ship, or
            sell Wax ourselves.</strong> Sales contracts are between the buyer and the
            seller; we facilitate discovery, payment, escrow, and dispute resolution.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section n="2" title="Eligibility">
          <p>
            You must be at least 18 years old and legally able to form a contract
            in your jurisdiction. You may use the Service only for lawful purposes.
            One person, one account — duplicate accounts are grounds for termination.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sellers must be based in the United States</strong> and able
            to complete identity verification through Stripe Connect (US tax ID,
            US bank account or debit card, US address). Buyers may be located
            outside the United States, but every order ships to a US shipping
            address — international forwarding services are at the buyer&apos;s
            sole risk and Buyer Protection coverage ends once the carrier
            confirms delivery to the original US address.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section n="3" title="Sellers — payouts and identity verification">
          <p>
            All payouts run through{" "}
            <strong>Stripe Connect Express</strong>. Before listing any product, you
            must complete Stripe&apos;s identity verification (legal name, address,
            date of birth, last 4 of SSN, and bank account or debit card for
            payouts). Stripe — not WaxDepot — performs KYC, OFAC screening, and tax
            reporting (1099-K) for your account.
          </p>
          <p>
            You authorize WaxDepot to instruct Stripe to release escrowed funds to
            your connected account on your behalf, net of WaxDepot&apos;s fees.
            Payouts arrive on your seller-tier&apos;s cadence (Starter: weekly Friday;
            Pro: twice weekly Tue + Fri; Elite: every 3 days; Apex: daily).
          </p>
        </Section>

            <li>
              <strong>Factory-sealed</strong> sports trading card products in

              Pre-orders are permitted if you can ship within 30 days of the

              listing (other than properly disclosed pre-orders).
            </li>
            <li>Anything illegal under federal, state, or local law.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            By listing, you represent and warrant that the product is in your
            possession (or properly disclosed pre-order), in factory-sealed
            condition, and that you have the right to sell it.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section n="5" title="Fees">
          <p>
            WaxDepot charges a flat seller commission per completed sale, deducted
            from the payout. There are no listing fees, monthly fees, or payment
            processing surcharges (we absorb Stripe&apos;s ~2.9% + $0.30 internally).
          </p>
          <p>
            Sellers qualify for a tier upgrade by hitting <strong>either</strong>{" "}
            the rolling-30-day sales count <strong>or</strong> the rolling-30-day
            sales-volume threshold, plus the minimum positive-feedback bar. Tiers
            are recalculated nightly.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Grace period.</strong> Once you qualify for a tier, your
            benefits are locked in <strong>through the end of the next
            calendar month</strong>. Re-qualifying any day during that window
            extends the lock to the new "end of next month" anchor. You only
            drop tier if you go a full grace window without re-qualifying.
            Promotions to a higher tier apply <strong>immediately</strong>.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm text-white/60">
            Examples: qualify for Pro on May 15 → benefits good through
            June 30. Re-qualify on June 5 → extended through July 31. Hit
            Elite on June 20 while in Pro grace → instantly upgraded to
            Elite, new lock through July 31.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cancellation cap on tier upgrades.</strong> Sellers
            with <strong>more than 2 seller-initiated cancellations</strong>{" "}
            in the rolling 30-day window cannot earn or extend a tier
            upgrade. Cancels do not demote your existing tier — they just
            block the next promotion until your cancel count drops back
            to 2 or below. Every cancel requires a written reason that
            becomes part of the order record.

          <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-6">

            </li>

          <p>
            Buyers pay no fees beyond the item price, shipping, and any applicable
            taxes shown at checkout.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section n="6" title="Buyer Protection — escrow and dispute window">
          <p>
            <strong>Every order is escrowed.</strong> When a buyer pays, the funds
            are held by WaxDepot via Stripe and are not transferred to the seller
            until either (a) the buyer confirms delivery, or (b) <strong>2 days
            after the carrier marks the package delivered</strong>, whichever is
            sooner.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Dispute window:</strong> A buyer may open a dispute within{" "}
            <strong>2 days of delivery</strong> — the same window as the
            auto-release timer above — if the box arrives resealed, damaged,
            wrong product, counterfeit, or if the contents have been tampered
            with. Disputes opened within this window hold funds in escrow
            until resolved, even if the 2 days lapse during review. WaxDepot
            will review evidence (photos, packaging condition, video of
            unboxing if provided) and may, at its sole discretion, refund the
            buyer in full from escrow.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sellers waive the right to chargeback on disputes resolved
            through WaxDepot&apos;s process.</strong> Sellers may appeal a dispute
            outcome via support within 7 days of resolution.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section n="7" title="Shipping">
          <p>
            Sellers must ship within <strong>2 business days</strong> of order
            placement using a tracked carrier (USPS, UPS, FedEx). Tracking must
            be entered through the &quot;Mark shipped&quot; flow on the seller&apos;s
            order page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Items priced at $500+ require <strong>signature confirmation</strong>.
            Items priced at $1,000+ require <strong>signature confirmation and
            insurance for the full sale value</strong>. Failure to insure or
            obtain signature is at the seller&apos;s risk and forfeits Buyer
            Protection coverage in their favor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Buyers are responsible for accurate shipping addresses at checkout.
            Reshipment due to a wrong address provided by the buyer is at the
            buyer&apos;s expense.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section n="8" title="Bids">
          <p>
            A bid is a binding offer to purchase at the bid price. If a seller
            accepts your bid, your card on file will be charged automatically and
            an escrowed order is created. You may cancel an active bid at any
            time before it&apos;s accepted; you may not retract a bid once accepted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sellers may not bid on their own listings or on any listing of an
            account they control. Coordinated price manipulation (&quot;<strong>shill
            bidding</strong>&quot;) is grounds for permanent termination.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section n="9" title="Prohibited conduct">
          <p>You agree not to:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-6">
            <li>List counterfeit, resealed, or tampered-with product</li>
            <li>Engage in shill bidding or other price manipulation</li>
            <li>Take transactions off-platform to evade fees</li>
            <li>Harass, threaten, or defame other users in messages or reviews</li>
            <li>
              Reverse-engineer, scrape, or attempt to gain unauthorized access to
              the Service
            </li>
            <li>
              Submit false dispute claims, including claiming non-receipt of a
              package the carrier confirmed as delivered to your address
            </li>
            <li>Use the Service to launder funds or violate any law</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Violations may result in listing removal, account suspension,
            permanent ban, and forfeiture of any pending balance toward refunds
            of affected buyers.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section n="10" title="Taxes">
          <p>
            Sellers are responsible for income tax on their proceeds. Stripe will
            issue you a Form 1099-K when applicable.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sales tax:</strong> Where required by state marketplace
            facilitator laws, WaxDepot will collect and remit sales tax on
            qualifying transactions. In states where we are not yet required to
            collect, buyers may owe use tax on their purchases — WaxDepot does
            not advise buyers on individual tax obligations.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section n="11" title="Termination">
          <p>
            You may close your account at any time via account settings. We may
            suspend or terminate your account for any violation of these Terms,
            for any conduct we believe poses a risk to the Service or other
            users, or for any other reason at our sole discretion.
          </p>
          <p>
            On termination, any pending payouts will be released to you minus
            any amounts owed to WaxDepot or to buyers via dispute resolution.
            Active listings will be removed; in-flight orders will continue
            through their normal lifecycle (ship, deliver, release, or refund).
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section n="12" title="Disclaimer of warranties">
          <p>
            The Service is provided &quot;<strong>as is</strong>&quot; and &quot;
            <strong>as available</strong>&quot; without warranty of any kind. We do
            not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or
            secure. Listings are created by sellers, not WaxDepot — we do not
            warrant the accuracy of any listing&apos;s description, photo, or
            availability.

        <Section n="13" title="Limitation of liability">
          <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, WaxDepot&apos;s total
            liability to you for any claim arising out of or relating to the
            Service or these Terms is limited to the greater of (a) $100, or
            (b) the total fees you paid WaxDepot in the 12 months preceding
            the claim.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are not liable for indirect, incidental, consequential,
            special, or punitive damages, including lost profits or lost data,
            even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

        <Section n="14" title="Indemnification">
          <p>
            You agree to indemnify and hold harmless WaxDepot, its officers,
            employees, and agents from any claim, demand, or damage arising
            from your breach of these Terms, your violation of any law or
            third-party right, or your use of the Service.

        <Section n="15" title="Dispute resolution and arbitration">
          <p>
            <strong>You and WaxDepot agree to resolve disputes through binding
            individual arbitration</strong>, not in court, except for small-claims
            actions and claims for injunctive relief related to intellectual
            property. Arbitration will be administered by JAMS under its
            Streamlined Arbitration Rules. Hearings will be conducted{" "}
            <strong>remotely</strong> by default; if either party requests an
            in-person hearing, it will be held in <strong>Sheridan County,
            Wyoming</strong> or another location both parties agree to in
            writing.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Class actions are waived.</strong> You may bring claims only
