            A <strong>sealed case</strong> is a manufacturer&apos;s factory-sealed
            outer carton containing N units of the same single-box variant —
            never opened, never repackaged. A Hobby Case typically holds 12
            hobby boxes; a Mega Case holds ~6 mega boxes; a Blaster Case holds
            ~20 blasters; a Pokemon Booster Box Case holds ~6 booster boxes.
            Each is its own SKU with its own market price (a sealed case
            usually trades at a slight discount per unit vs. buying N
            individual boxes — buyers pay a premium for guaranteed sealed
            provenance from the case-fresh layer).
