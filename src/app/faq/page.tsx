    questions: [
      {
        q: "How do I buy a box?",
        a: "Pick a product, click Buy now, and pay with any card (Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Cash App work in supported browsers). Your payment is held in escrow at Stripe. The seller gets paid only after the box arrives sealed and you confirm — or 2 days after the carrier marks it delivered, whichever comes first.",
      },
      {
        q: "How are bids different from buying?",
        a: "Bids are an offer to buy below the lowest ask. If a seller accepts your bid, your card is charged automatically and an order is created. You can set how long the bid stays active (1-30 days). If the lowest ask drops to or below your bid, you buy instantly.",
      },

        q: "What if my box arrives resealed or tampered with?",

            Open a dispute within 3 days of delivery. We&apos;ll review evidence
            (photos of the wrap, packaging, and the box itself; an unboxing
            video helps) and refund you in full from escrow if the claim
            checks out. Read{" "}

        ),
      },
      {
        q: "Are there buyer fees?",
        a: "No buyer fees. You pay the listed price plus shipping plus any applicable sales tax. The seller covers WaxDepot's 10% commission out of their proceeds.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is sales tax collected?",
        a: "We collect and remit sales tax in states where we've crossed marketplace facilitator nexus thresholds. In states where we haven't, no sales tax appears at checkout — you may owe use tax to your state, which is your responsibility.",
      },

  {
    title: "Selling",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "What can I list?",
        a: "Factory-sealed sports trading card products in original manufacturer packaging — Hobby Box, Jumbo Box, Mega Box, Blaster Box, Hanger Box, Value Box, FotL Hobby Box, etc. No singles, no breaks, no graded slabs, no opened or resealed product.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do I get paid?",
        a: "We use Stripe Connect Express for payouts. Set up your account at /sell/payouts — Stripe handles ID verification, bank linking, tax forms, and 1099-K reporting. Once a sale releases from escrow, the funds (sale price minus your tier fee) transfer directly to your bank.",
      },
      {
        q: "What's the fee structure?",
        a: "10% (Starter) on every sale. Drops to 8% (Pro) at 100+ sales/month with 99%+ positive feedback, and 6% (Elite) at 500+ sales/month with 99.5%+ feedback. No listing fees, no monthly fees, no payment processing surcharge — we absorb Stripe's 2.9% + $0.30 internally.",
      },
      {
        q: "How fast do I have to ship?",
        a: "Within 2 business days of order placement. Items priced at $200+ require signature confirmation; items priced at $1,000+ require signature confirmation AND insurance for the full sale value. Use any tracked carrier (USPS, UPS, FedEx) — drop the tracking number into your seller dashboard.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I list pre-orders?",
        a: "Yes, if you can ship within 30 days of the manufacturer's public release date. Pre-order listings must be marked as such (the catalog auto-handles this for upcoming releases).",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "Escrow & disputes",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "When does the seller actually get paid?",
        a: "When the buyer confirms the box arrived sealed, OR 2 days after the carrier marks the package delivered, whichever comes first. The 2-day auto-release prevents sellers from waiting forever for a buyer who's gone silent.",
      },
      {
        q: "What disputes are eligible for refund?",
        a: "Resealed wrap, wrong product, counterfeit, contents tampered with, or never delivered (carrier never scanned). Buyer remorse, change of mind, or 'I expected better hits' are not eligible — sealed wax is sealed wax, you're paying for the chance, not the result.",
      },
      {
        q: "What happens if there's a chargeback?",
        a: "We aggressively defend chargebacks on legitimate sales using carrier tracking + signature confirmation as evidence. If the dispute happened within our normal window, the buyer should have used the dispute process; chargebacks attempting to bypass it are likely to be reversed.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    title: "Account & privacy",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "Do I need to be verified to buy?",
        a: "No. Buyers just need an email + payment method.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do I need to be verified to sell?",
        a: "Yes. All sellers complete Stripe Connect identity verification (KYC) — name, address, DOB, last 4 of SSN, bank account. Stripe runs the verification; we just gate the listing form on the result.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I delete my account?",
